[![moodle-docker CI](https://github.com/andrewrowatt-masseyuni/moodle-local_faultreporting/actions/workflows/moodle-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/andrewrowatt-masseyuni/moodle-local_faultreporting/actions/workflows/moodle-ci.yml)

Provides a simple user-interface to gather information about technical (non-pedagogical) issues with the LMS and send them to a case management system e.g, Assyst.

## Installing via uploaded ZIP file

1.  Log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to *Site administration \> Plugins \> Install plugins*.
2.  Upload the ZIP file with the plugin code. You should only be prompted to add extra details if your plugin type is not automatically detected.
3.  Check the plugin validation report and finish the installation.

## Installing manually

The plugin can be also installed by putting the contents of this directory to

```
{your/moodle/dirroot}/local/faultreporting
```

Afterwards, log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to *Site administration \> Notifications* to complete the installation.

Alternatively, you can run

```
$ php admin/cli/upgrade.php
```

to complete the installation from the command line.
